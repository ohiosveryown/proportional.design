Building a box is surprisingly more difficult than it looks. Another attribute that adds to the challenge is a waterfall miter joint. A waterfall miter joint is a joint on a table that allows the grain to flow right through the joint, from the top to the sides, giving the appearance of a seamless waterfall.

Angled or miter corners can be tricky because the corners of all 45º angles have to be precise. Any inaccurate angles, even by just a half degree compound over four corners: 0.5º \* 4  = 2º. Two degrees is a big deal when making anything, especially a miter box.

For the Mercury Nightstand, I chose to go with a waterfall miter. I also wanted to kind of juxtapose the crisp edges with some sort of round or organic shape. These incorporated shapes ended up being the bottom corners of the drawer face, as well as the bottom edges of the left and right sides.

The first step I took was getting the proportions right. The nightstands were to be pretty deep and wide. Although the sketch above shows 16” in depth, I believe the final was around 18”. You can see the bottom edges have the radius I was talking about earlier.

I picked some really nice figured walnut and since this was a waterfall box, it’s important to think about how the grain will flow. Imagine a long sheet of paper that gets folded at two planes. What you want to do is account for the total length of two sides and the top for when you laminate the boards.

There’s no real trick when cutting 45’s, the best way that works for me when it comes to wide boards or panels is to use a track saw with a straight edge. If the board or panel is small enough, I typically use a table saw sled and make sure I clamp the piece both done and tight to the back fence. Here I just used the track saw method.

With the box laid on its side, you can see how the long laminated panel gets cut and “folded” so the grain looks like it’s wrapping around the sides and top. You can also just barely see that I cut a bevel along the front edges of the board. It’s obviously done before the miters are cut, but I suppose you could use a really large chamfer bit to do it after the fact.

Once I have the miters cut, but before glue up, I marked a large radius on the bottom corners and rough cut them at the bandsaw. I then sanded them to final dimensions with my spindle sander. Above you can see how the radius turned out as I started to sand the component.

I had a little bit of cleanup on the bevel after I cut the rounded corners. I just used a little block plane and chisel to connect the bottom with the sides.

For the drawer, I used Blum undermount, soft close drawer slides. They can be a little tricky to use because the drawer box has to be spec’d to the proper size, but it’s not too bad. The box is made from mdf, it will be painted white in the end so mdf is a good, cheap choice.

Another cool little feature that's incorporated into these nightstands is the hidden, wireless charger. It’s identified on the top side with a circle inlay, while the bottom is routed out, almost the entire thickness of the panel to allow for the charger to work.

For finish, I went with a water based lacquer. I find it enhances the color without tinting or yellowing the color. It holds up well to moderate use and is easy to reapply if any future repairs need to be made.
