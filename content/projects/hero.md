The Hiro Chair was my first venture into chairmaking. It’s heavily inspired by Danish and Japanese styles, in particular the [PP501 chair by Hans Wegner](https://www.pamono.com/stories/the-one-only). I love how the back and arms flow together, almost as if it’s one piece of wood, but if you look close enough, you can see the large finger joints.
