The Hiro Chair was my first venture into chairmaking. It’s heavily inspired by Danish and Japanese styles, in particular the [PP501 chair by Hans Wegner](https://www.pamono.com/stories/the-one-only). I love how the back and arms flow together, almost as if it’s one piece of wood, but if you look close enough you can see the large finger joints. Needless to say, for my first chair, this was diving into the deep end.
