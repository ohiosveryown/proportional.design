If I had to guess, I’d say woodworking is probably 70% planning and order of operations, 20% fixing dumb mistakes, and 10% execution. A project pretty much never comes together perfectly with zero challenges along the way. This table was no exception, however the biggest variable from the formula above was a client wanting to make a design change halfway through the build.

Originally, the Swan Table was meant to be a standard, small, circular dining table. Most tables are around 30” off the floor and this one was no exception – at least initially. It was to have pretty standard, tapered legs but evolved into a hightop table, with a pretty interesting pyramid base.

### Begin

The first step was picking lumber and checking for any majors knots or cracks. This table was made from white oak and the stock I got was really wide; close to 13” at some points. I roughly marked the general blanks I’ll need and then cut them to size. Everything here is rough and oversized.

Once things were cut to rough size, I began to orient the boards to find the best grain match. All the boards were flat sawn so I didn’t have many options, but I was still able to get some nice relationships between the various boards. Next, I jointed the boards and ripped them to equal width and got them set up for glueing.

### Circles & Squares

For the round top I broke out the circle cutting jig and the router, of course you could achieve the same results with a jigsaw. When cutting a with the router, it’s important to go slow and take shallow passes to not stress the bit and create tear out ini the workpiece.

It was at about this time when we change the style of the legs, both height and overall design. The new ones compliment the round top and will be associated with hight top chairs or stools.

The new legs were from 8/4 stock. I created a template for repeatability and template routing. First I transfer the template lines to the stock, rough cut it on the band saw, then finish up the shape with the router and a flush trim bit.

This was my first time making this style base. It was pretty cool, it gives almost an optical illusion depending on how you’re looking at it. There’s a slight vertical angle so the tops are actually more narrow than the bottoms.

I debating using bridle joints for the legs and “feet” but ultimately ended up going with mortise and tenon joinery. I rounded the edges with a 3/16” round over bit . The grain on the base was definitely my favorite from this project. There were [ray flecks](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=ray+flecks&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) everywhere, and straight grain white oak is so nice.

### Trippin'

With the project about wrapped up, Mirely and I took a trip out west. We even got to see some very old, petrified wood.

Once we got back, I was able to finish sanding and apply the finish. I’ve used Rubio Monocoat a bunch in the past, but this was my first time using the cottonwhite variant. It was a little too washed out for my tastes, but it went on well and definitely pronounced the grain even further.
