Typically there are only a handful of ways to bend wood. You can steam bend it, kerf cut it, or cut thin strips to then laminate together at various curves. When I make seats for the Hero chair, I actually don't use any of these methods. Instead, I work with 8/4 stock and cut the curve into the blank. It's a lot more wasteful but I find it to be much quicker and less error prone.

Depending on how the cut is oriented, you can sometimes take flat sawn stock and end up with more appealing quarter sawn stock. The only potential downside to this method, aside from the waste, is that sometimes after the cut is made, you can find some hidden knots.
