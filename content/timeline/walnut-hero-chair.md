### Intro

Typically there are only a handful of ways to bend wood. You can steam bend it, kerf cut it, or cut thin strips to then laminate them together to create a curve. When I make seats for the Hero chair, I actually don't use any of these methods. Instead, I work with 8/4 stock and cut the curve into the blank. It's a lot more wasteful but I find it to be much quicker and less error prone.

Depending on how the cut is oriented, you can sometimes take flat sawn stock and end up with more appealing quarter sawn stock. The only potential downside to this method, aside from the waste, is that sometimes after the cut is made, you can find some hidden knots.

### Planning

Before any cutting, I clamp the pieces together and cut the overall size to rough length and width â€“ this is easier before the curves are cut in.

Once the overall blank is cut to rough size, I use a template to transfer the curves onto the individual blanks and then rough cut them vertically on the band saw.

I should mention, I typically cut mortises in the blanks first (you can see the tenons in the first photo) to help with alignment when itâ€™s time for glueup. After the glue is dry, all thatâ€™s left is to complete the final shaping and do any finish sanding.

It always helps to have an extra set of hands. The image below is an in progress picture of a white oak version of the Hiro Chair.
