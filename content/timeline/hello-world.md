As I've been building furniture more seriously for the past two and a half years, I've wanted to document builds and progress, if for nothing else than a repository for me to revisit – and maybe even offer some insight into how I build things.

The first iteration of proportional.design had some limitations, the biggest being it was a pain to update and wasn't very blog-like.
