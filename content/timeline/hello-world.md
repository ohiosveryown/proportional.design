Meet the new site, same as the old site ‚Äì not really. As I've been building furniture more seriously for the past three years, I've wanted to document builds and progress, if for nothing else than a repository for me to revisit ‚Äì¬†and maybe even offer some insight into how I build things.

Over the last three years, as I‚Äôve been building furniture more consistently (and more seriously), I‚Äôve been wanting to document more of the process. It's nice to be able to reflect and think about not just the final about, but the journey as well; as corny as that sounds.

The first iteration of¬†[proportional.design](https://6050e4a79c3a7d0008a9d073--proportional-design-v1.netlify.app/)[](https://proportional.design)¬†was definitely not set up to support a blogging style experience. Not only that, but the architecture of how I originally built the site supported just a single image per project, and so a goal of mine for the new site was to support more content.

The design of the new iteration is actually based on an image of a tweet I had posted. My goal was to have the site feel more ‚Äúapplication‚Äù like.

The front-end is built on Nuxt.js which is typically my go-to. I also incorporated netlify CMS which will make updating the site a lot easier and will hopefully encourage me to post more.

I‚Äôm sure at some point I‚Äôll post more about the design and development but for now, if you‚Äôre curious, you can check out the [source here](https://github.com/ohiosveryown/proportional.design).
