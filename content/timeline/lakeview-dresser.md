### Starting with a base (not really)

Recently I've been working on a solid walnut dresser and wanted to share progress on the base. The carcass of the dresser has rounded, mitered corners, and the client wanted those curves incorporated into the base. We decided on a design where the stretchers round into the legs and middle support.

Originally the feet and stretchers were to be bridle joints, but after not having enough material on hand, I went with standard floating tenon joinery to attach the feet to the stretchers – still looks pretty sharp with the contrasting grain directions.
