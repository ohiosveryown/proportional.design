"In 1894, Jacques De Morgan discovered a group of boats at the pyramid complex of Khakaure Senwosret III at Dahshur. Butterfly, or dovetail, joints were recorded as being used. Some archaeologists argue that the dovetail joints were not originally fitted for the boats but were a modern replacement."[^1]
